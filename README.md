# Hey all!

I'm [learning Java](https://www.udemy.com/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/) in these parts...

Each lesson has it's own folder. Initially, I didn't plan on tracking my history this way, but I thought it'd be cool if you were able to see my learning process.

Heavier coding challenges will be done in separate repositories.

###### Thank you for taking an interest in my code!

#### Best,

### Alexander.
